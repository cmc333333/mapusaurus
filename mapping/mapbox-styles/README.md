# Base MapBox Styles

Should you want to tweak the layer data we've created (e.g. to modify
transparency, change hue, add MapBox layers), you can import the "Styles" from
this directory into your MapBox account.

We're developing a longer term export option for you to easily recreate the
data, but importing our MapBox styles should be enough to get you started.
